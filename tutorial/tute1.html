                    <div><h3>How do you use Internet?</h3></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Internet, one of the most incredible innovations helping human's lifes much better.
                            
                        <br>It also becomes a part of our lifes. In my experience, the Internet helps me connecting myself
                        to my friends and knowing more about my friends.

                        <br> It also helps me to keep track on the news 
                        with flexible time and the news can be updated immediately. Thanks to Internet, my life is much
                        more wonderful within music, knowledge and concepts. </p>

                    <div><h3>What websites do you visit? (NB:"family friendly"!)</h3></div>
                    <div><p>Billions of websites but I can say that no one could use that much. My favourite 
                        web which I use a lot is Youtube, Facebook, Gmail and Netflix. 

                        <br>One of them has different functions to satisfy the customers and most of the time I use them to entertain in my spare time
                        Websites are good, just the contents could be bad. 
                    </p></div>

                    <div><h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3></div>
                    <div><p>I am a fresher in both programming and web design. I love to do both of them
                        because one can not work well without the other and as the web developer in the future

                        <br>I desire to learn both of them. In order to use my creativity and coding skills to 
                        solve problems and develop our lifes. 
                    </p></div>
